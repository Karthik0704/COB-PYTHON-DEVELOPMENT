This is an example text file for testing the word frequency program.

In this text, we have various words, and we want to find out how many times each word occurs. Words like "example," "text," and "program" will likely have higher frequencies.

Each word frequency will be counted, and the program will display the results.

Let's continue with some more words to make this file a bit larger. Here are some additional words:

testing, Python, programming, language, script, example, file, word, frequency, count, unique, occurrence, code, run, main, module, imported, executed, block, function, script, executed, directly, variable, value, if, name, set, define, entry, point, save, in, to, when, as, output, from, my, some, is, we, and, have, this, an, The, for, of, with, at, it, on, be, has, can, you, not, but, or, into, will, also, other, used, that, check, whether, way, idiom, common, a, construct, This, Here's, how, works, If, special, import, should, example, like, will, more, make, bit, some, Let's, we, here, additional, Here, are, Let's, continue, with, we, Let's, file, a, this, make, to, words, more, some, are, Here, additional, here, are, Let's, continue, with, we, Let's, file, a, this, make, to, words, more, some, are, Here, additional, here, are, Let's, continue, with, we, Let's, file, a, this, make, to, words, more, some, are, Here, additional, here, are, Let's, continue, with, we, Let's, file, a, this, make, to, words, more, some, are.

This should be enough text to test the program effectively.
